# **Dead Dice**  
## Formerly known as drop dead.
----

### **Objective:**

  Create a browser based game that accurately models a standard game of 'Drop Dead'  

---

### **Instructions:**
    1. The goal of the game is to win by accumulating more points than your opponent by the end of the game.
    2. Accumulate points by rolling your five dice, but watch out! If any of your dice land on a two or a five, they are then discarded and can no longer be rolled. 
    3. Each players turn lasts until all of their dice are discarded. 
    4. Once both players turns are over, the scores are compared, and the player with highest score wins the game.
