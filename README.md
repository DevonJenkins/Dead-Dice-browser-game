### **Objective:**

  Create a browser based game that accurately models a standard game of 'Drop Dead'  

---

### **Instructions:**
  1. The goal of the game is to win by accumulating more points than your opponent by the end of the game.
  2. Accumulate points by rolling your five dice, but watch out! If any of your dice land on a two or a five, they are then discarded and can no longer be rolled. 
  3. Each players turn lasts until all of their dice are discarded. 
  4. Once both players turns are over, the scores are compared, and the player with highest score wins the game.

## **Game Requirements:**
- On loading, a blank gameboard is initialized, and the status message informs the user that it is player one's turn.
- During player one's turn, the player is able to click the roll button to roll their five dice.  
- As the dice are rolled, any twos and fives get discarded into a separate dice container. The remaining dice on every roll should then contribute towards the current player's score. 
- Once player one has rolled all five of their dice, player two gets to play their turn.
- Player two should be able to roll their five dice to contribute to the score until all of their dice have been discarded. 
- When both players dice have been discarded, the game ends and the scores are compared.
- Winner is determined by highest score.
